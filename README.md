# Daneel-AI

> ⚠️ Work-in-progress research & prototyping project exploring a calm, trustworthy personal AI assistant / digital twin — designed to live inside your workflow, not outside it.

## What this is

Daneel is an exploratory project to build a personal AI teammate that learns your style, supports your thinking, and embeds into the flow of work — instead of asking you to go talk to a separate “AI box.”

Early, messy, experimental, and evolving. We're learning what’s genuinely helpful, not chasing hype demos.

## What we're trying to explore

- Can a personal AI adapt to your voice, context, and long-term goals?
- What does _embedded_, not _adjacent_, AI look like?
- How can AI support clarity, focus, deep work, and better decisions?
- What patterns enable **private, personal memory + context** over time?
- How do we build augmentation, not delegation — you stay in the loop?

## Early directions & goals

### Human-centered capabilities

- **Personal style modeling**
  Tone, communication patterns, preferences — used thoughtfully

- **Workflow-native support**
  Show up in calendars, docs, inbox, notes, tasks — where work actually happens

- **Project + context memory**
  Help recall goals, threads, decisions, ongoing work — under your control

- **Decision support**
  Surface trade-offs, risks, strategic perspectives — not answers pushed at you

- **Calm UX**
  Assist quietly, nudge gently, never interrupt or overwhelm

### Technical exploration

- **Deep RAG + long-term context**
  Slow thinking loops, knowledge grounding, personal memory mechanisms

- **Multi-model orchestration**
  Different models for reasoning, style, privacy-sensitive tasks, speed vs depth

- **Embedded agent workflows**
  Examples:

  - inbox + calendar assistance
  - research + synthesis cycles
  - writing + editing loops in-document
  - planning + check-in flows
  - task scaffolding + follow-through support

- **Privacy-first**
  Personal data stays personal.
  Open, inspectable building blocks as we go.

Goal: a tool that sits alongside you as you work — not a destination you have to “go use.”

## Status

Today this is:

- prototypes + notebooks + architecture sketches
- UI + workflow experiments
- RAG + memory trials
- lots of learning + rewriting

Expect rough edges, rapid change, and exploration.

## Getting Started

Setup docs coming soon as things stabilize.
Want to experiment early? Open an issue.

## Tech Ingredients (moving target)

- LLMs (mix of OSS + commercial)
- Vector + structured memory stores
- Workflow engines + reflection loops
- Local + cloud hybrid privacy model
- OS-level + app-level integration prototypes

We’ll document once the foundation is clearer.

## Contributing

Not open for broad contributions yet — still shaping the architecture.
Curiosity, thoughtful critique, and ideas welcome.

## License

TBD (leaning permissive once core pieces mature)

## Acknowledgment

Named after Asimov’s **R. Daneel Olivaw** as a reminder that intelligence systems can be built to be supportive, aligned, and trustworthy.
